# Flight-Data
Filters through a csv file with flights. Given command line arguments you can specify certain things about the flight you are looking for. Did this work for a class assignment. You must specify in the command line argument the data file that you would like to use, using the format '--DATA="The-File-To-Use.csv"'. The filters that you can enter in the command line are the airline, the source city, the source country, the destination city, and the destination country. To enter a filter put it in the format of '--FILTER="Contents"'

Here is an example of what to enter in the command line:

./route_manager --DATA="airline-routes-data.csv" --AIRLINE="SWR" --DEST_COUNTRY="Argentina"

There are more examples of what to enter in the TEST.md file.
